# Human template space transforms

This repository provides pairwise human template space transformation assets.
It's built on top of [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs) (for transformation)
and [templateflow](https://github.com/templateflow/templateflow) (for access to
high-quality templates) which is in turn dependent on
[DataLad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad) (for data management and access).

The transformation files are inside the `xfms` directory and are sensibly named.
